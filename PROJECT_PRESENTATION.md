- NPM Install ✅
- Install Vitest ✅
- Brainstorm with team and think of ideas we can use for our Katas ✅
- Come to a decison of the Kata we would like to create ✅
- First I want to create the function that i want people to solve ✅
- When function is created now I will begin creating the tests ✅
- First import the function into my test file ✅
- Next i will import test and expect from vitest ✅
- Now i will create a dummy test to ensure the test is working ✅
- Now i will start creating my test ✅
- First i want to give a name to describe my test ✅
- Next i will put into the expect my function with an array of number ✅
- Then i will place the expected result in the toequals brackets ✅
- Now I will run my test to see if it works ✅
- if it works than i will create a few more test ✅
- now i will write a description of the kata for potential problem solvers ✅
- Give examples of what the output of the function show look like ✅
- Then I will delete the solution so problem solvers will not see the solution ✅
- If I have time I will repeat the above steps and create a more Kata's, if not i will move straight on to the next point ✅
- Push the file to my github repository ✅
- Post on learn worlds platform so people can access and attempt the kata ✅

The reason for my Katas is because I am a great lover of maths and it only made sense for me to create challenges which were maths related. It was at first a little challenge for me to create the functions especially the sumArray one so I think it will be a very fun and balanced challenge. I am excited to see if my fellow bootcampers will take a different approach in creating the function then I have.

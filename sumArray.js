/**
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `sumArray` which takes in an Array and returns to me the sum of the Array. 
 *
 * The fucntion should be able to take in any integer and give me the correct sum of all the number no matter how long the array is.
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `sumArray([1,2,3,4,5])` should return 15 
 *    `sumArray([-8,-4,3,12,92])` should return 95 
 * !! Remember to remove the skips from the sumArray.test.js file
 */


export function sumArray(numbers) {

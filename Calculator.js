/**
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `Calculator` which takes in two numbers and an operator and returns the correct calculation. AT the end I need a functioning calculator which can add, minus,multiply and divide.
 *
 * The function should be able to take in any number and give me the correct answer.
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `calulator(10,5,'/')` should return 2 as the operator is dividing 
 *    `calulator(3,2,'*')` should return 6 as the operator is multiplying 
 */

export function calulator(num1,num2,operator){
  
   }
